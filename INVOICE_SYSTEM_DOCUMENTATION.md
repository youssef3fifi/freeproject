**Backward Compatibility:**

## Database Schema Enhancements

The system supports extended invoice table columns:
- `customer_name`: VARCHAR(255) for customer name

- `subtotal`: FLOAT for subtotal before discount

**Note**: The system gracefully handles both extended and basic database schemas for backward compatibility.
